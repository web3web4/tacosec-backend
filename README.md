## User Reporting System

The application includes a comprehensive user reporting system that allows users to report inappropriate behavior. This system helps maintain community standards and protect users.

### Features

- **User Reporting**: Users can report other users by username for inappropriate behavior with a specific reason.
- **Report Management**: Administrators can view and manage reports through dedicated endpoints.
- **Automatic Restrictions**: When a user receives 10 or more unresolved reports, they are automatically restricted from sharing passwords.
- **Restricted Sharing**: Users with sharing restrictions can only share passwords with users who have previously shared passwords with them.
- **Report Resolution**: Administrators can resolve reports, which automatically recalculates the user's report count and removes restrictions if appropriate.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /reports`: Submit a report against another user by username
- `GET /reports/user/:telegramId`: (Admin only) Get all reports for a specific user
- `GET /reports/is-restricted/:telegramId`: Check if a user has sharing restrictions
- `PATCH /reports/resolve/:id`: (Admin only) Resolve a report
- `GET /reports/admin/reported-users`: (Admin only) Get all reported users with their details and reports

### Implementation Details

The reporting system is implemented as a separate module (`ReportsModule`) with its own schema, service, and controller. It integrates with the password sharing functionality to enforce sharing restrictions when necessary.

When a user attempts to share a password, the system checks if they have any sharing restrictions. If they do, it verifies that they're only sharing with users who have previously shared passwords with them.

Users are reported by username, which is then resolved to the corresponding telegramId internally. This makes the reporting process more user-friendly, as users can report others by their visible username rather than needing to know their telegramId.

### Security Considerations

- Users cannot report themselves
- Users cannot report the same user multiple times (only unresolved reports count)
- Only administrators can view all reports and resolve them
- Sharing restrictions are automatically removed when the number of unresolved reports falls below the threshold
- Username lookups are case-insensitive for better user experience
